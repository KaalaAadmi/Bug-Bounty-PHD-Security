# RECON
- try finding the less travelled doamins to find more bugs.
- check for out of scopes and inside scopes for domains and bugs.
- if it is mentioned not to scan networks, then DONT scan networks, otherwise, go for it :)

## Tools:
password for kali on wsl: kali
- gedit is used to save text files.
    - gedit <filename>.txt --> to create a new text file.
- sublist3r is used for finding sub-domains
    - `sublist3r -d <domain.com>`
    - check for the sub-domains found using this method by putting all of the subdomains in openList extension, in firefox it is known as Tab List. This will open all the subdomains in firefox.
- amass - is used for finding subdomains. It is extremely amazing if we can get it to work. But it should work.
    - `amass enum -d <domain.com>`
    - You can also use it to find the IP addresses of the subdomains:
    - `amass enum -ip -d <domain.com>`
    - If `amass` is slow, then should run it with the flag: passive:
        `amass enum -passive -d <domain.com>`
- fuff - is used for finding subdomains and hidden files within the domain.
    - it is very fast so either slow it down or use it while using a vpn so if the IP gets banned, we can use our ip.
    - `ffuf -w <wordlist path> -d <https://domain.com/FUZZ>`
    - fuff basically replaces the words at the word FUZZ to find existing folders and subdomains
    - it brute-forces where the word FUZZ is
    - To slow down fuff, add `-p` flag with the delay in ms.
- dirb - is used to find the subdomains and hidden files within the domain:
    - `dirb <https://www.domain.com> (optional)<path to wordlist>`
- burpsuite - we can use this for multiple reasons.
    - PRO TIP: use foxy proxy to use this. :)
    switch on the proxy on web browser and switch intercept off then go throught the website.
- dig - used to find subdomains via zone transfers.
    - `dig axfr @<IP address> <target-domain.com>`
    - *If any sites are vulnerable to zone transfer then report it aas information disclosure as it should not be available to the web.*

- wpscan - this scans for all plugins in the wordpress site and checks if any are vulnerable to any attacks.
    - used for CTF in wordpress sites.
    - `wpscan -url <domain.com> -e ap --plugins-detection aggressive -o <output.txt>`
- shodan - you know what it is used for. it is PAID $70/month.
- wappalyzer - extension on firefox and check all the software stack used to develop that app.
## Vulnerability Scanners:
- nikto - scnas vulnerabilities by giving details about the web app.
        - `nikto -h <ip address of domain>`
